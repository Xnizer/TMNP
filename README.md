## Teenage Mutant Ninja Pythons
is a console game that I originally made as a practice while learning python. It's a very basic example of how to implement a small game/engine that can be extended to support more features.

**This project is an example of how to:**
- Implement a basic game engine with a game loop and update/draw functions.
- Manage game state, and separate game logic from rendering.
- Use native Windows API to interact with the console.
